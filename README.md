# Name: 
Real-time Bus Tracker 

***

# Description: 
Real-time Bus Tracker utilizes MapBox and real-time coordinates retrieved from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation authority in order to provide a graphical representation of the location for the bus on route 1. In addition to bus monitoring, with a click of a button, markers for all of the bus stops between MIT and Harvard appear as a small red bus. 

***

# Installation: 
The html, css, js and images needed are included. A MapBox access token is needed to access the Mapbox Api and is free for a certain amount of map loads when a mapbox account is made.

***

# Usage: 
This project can be used as it is to provide bus tracking or bus stop location. It can be further developed to an app or to provide directions.

# Support:

# Roadmap: 
In the future future improvements could be made by providing a toggle button for the bus stops. The map might also benefit from being centered on the bus being monitored. Multiple bus routes can be monitored with popup descriptions of the bus stops, buses and their corresponding routes would be helpful.
